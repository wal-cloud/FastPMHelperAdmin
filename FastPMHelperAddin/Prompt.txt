Change reopen to blue also.  On inline editing, if no action is selected it starts off not allowing selection of update, create, reopen as epected.  However when I toggle on create new, it then allows pressing reopen and close and if I press them it says select an action first.  It should just have them greyed out and not selectable.  Also if I go inline reply on an email with actions, at the start it actually only allows create new and update, it should allow all of them.  Again if I toggle one on, then all of them are available.
