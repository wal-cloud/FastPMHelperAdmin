Simplify existing sidebar UI and make more space efficient:
- Remove action row titles, these are pretty obvious from the context anyway.  Eg. Project, Package, Title, etc.  Just remove them completely.
- Put project/package on the same line.  Auto share width based on content.  If both need all space Project should take it.
- Also remove "related messages" label
- Put open all messages button inline with LinkedAction, near the tick mark button.  Text: Open All {message icon}
- Remove the "selected email" header and text, this was for testing and is unnessecary
- Remove the settings and make a gear icon at the top of the side bar (near the refresh sheet button) that opens a window which has these settings in them
- Project actions header is repeated twice, once in the title for the sidebar and once again as a header
