This is the final major piece of the puzzle. You are effectively building a **"Mini-Dashboard"** inside the sidebar.

This transforms the sidebar from just a "Email Processor" into your "Project Command Center."

Here is the prompt to build the **Dashboard + Lookup** section.

### Copy and Paste this into Claude:

**Context:**
I am building the "Command Center" section at the bottom of my VSTO Sidebar.
**Goal:** I want a quick way to see **Overdue Actions** and **Actions Assigned to Me**, as well as the ability to manually **Lookup** an action by ID.
**Current State:** I have the logic for "Overdue" (Red) and "With Me" (Yellow) which I use for visual indicators. I want to reuse this logic to populate two `ListView` controls.

**UI Layout Requirements (XAML):**
Add a new vertical section at the bottom of the sidebar (below the linked action form):

1. **Section 1: "Overdue Tasks" List**
* **Control:** `DataGrid` (or `ListView` with GridView).
* **Columns:** `Project` (Width=*), `Package` (Width=*), `Title` (Width=2*), `Ball Holder` (Width=*).
* **Visibility:** **Collapsed** if there are 0 overdue tasks. Visible if > 0.
* **Style:** Header text "Overdue" in **Red**. MaxHeight = 150px (Scrollable).


2. **Section 2: "With Me" List**
* **Control:** `DataGrid`.
* **Columns:** Same as above.
* **Visibility:** Always Visible (or collapsed if empty, your choice).
* **Style:** Header text "With Me" in **Amber/Yellow**. MaxHeight = 150px (Scrollable).


3. **Section 3: "Manual Lookup" (The Search Bar)**
* **UI:** `TextBox` (Placeholder "Action ID") + `Button` ("Go").


4. **Section 4: "Dashboard Results" (Shared View)**
* **Purpose:** When I select a row in *Overdue* OR *With Me*, OR use the *Search*, this area displays the details.
* **Header:** TextBlock showing the selected Action Title.
* **List:** The `RelatedEmails` DataGrid (Reuse the style from the upper section).
* **Button:** "Open All Messages".



**Logic Requirements (C#):**

**1. Data Loading (`RefreshDashboard`):**

* Create a method `RefreshDashboard()` called on Startup and after any Update.
* Filter the cached `_allActions` list:
* `OverdueList`: Where `DueDate < Today` AND `Status == Open`.
* `WithMeList`: Where `BallHolder` matches `MyName` (Reuse the existing "Yellow Dot" logic).


* Bind these collections to the UI.
* Handle Visibility: Set `OverdueGrid.Visibility = Collapsed` if count is 0.

**2. Interaction (`OnDashboardRowSelected`):**

* When a user clicks a row in "Overdue" or "With Me":
* Get the selected `ActionItem`.
* Trigger the **Lookup Logic** (same as typing the ID manually).
* Populate the "Dashboard Results" (Section 4) with the linked emails for that action.


* *Note:* This does NOT change the "Linked Action" form at the top (which is bound to the currently selected Outlook email). This bottom section is for independent browsing.

**3. Search Logic (`Search_Click`):**

* Same as previous: Find Action by ID  Populate Section 4.
* *Duplicate Handling:* If ID is duplicate, show the Resolver Popup, then Populate Section 4.

**What I need from you:**

1. **XAML:** The complete markup for this bottom "Dashboard" section.
2. **C#:**
* The `RefreshDashboard` method.
* The SelectionChanged handlers for the two DataGrids.
* The `LoadActionIntoDashboard(ActionItem action)` helper (which fetches emails and fills Section 4).



**Constraint:**
Ensure the "With Me" logic strictly follows the existing "My Name" settings match so the Yellow Dots and the "With Me" list represent the exact same data.

### Why this architecture works

By making the lists clickable, you don't just "see" that you are late; you click the red line, the emails load below, and you can immediately double-click an email to reply and fix the issue. It closes the loop instantly.
